# Bluise - A Nuxt.js & Netlify CMS boilerplate.

Many thanks to netlify for making this [Bluise template by Gomah for FREE](https://github.com/Gomah/bluise/blob/master/README.md). I forked this template on 20 JULY 2022 and am learning how to create PWA and how to use Netlify CMS. But I'm most impressed at the work done. So how do I proceed? Do I pay for this template? Can I continue to use it for FREE as I learn? 

Am so thankful for the opportunity to learn and to see the code even as you are browsing this public repo. So if I change it to private, am i "Stealing" a template? 

Apart from credits and acknowledgement, I don't want to disturb the original Bluise template. Will I accidentally update that template file when I work on this file? 

How do I update the dependencies when I don't even have a clue on Tailwind and the other files running this template so efficiently? 

Where do I go for help? 

Have totally removed all of the original readme for bluise template (21 JULY 2022), you can go to [GOMAH's repo](https://github.com/Gomah/bluise/blob/master/README.md) to read the original
